require 'ripple'

module Ripple
  # Represents a model stored in Riak, serialized in JSON object (document).
  # Ripple::Document models aim to be fully ActiveModel compatible, with a keen
  # eye toward features that developers expect from ActiveRecord, DataMapper and MongoMapper.
  #
  # Example:
  #
  #   class Email
  #     include Ripple::Document
  #     property :from,    String, :presence => true
  #     property :to,      String, :presence => true
  #     property :sent,    Time,   :default => proc { Time.now }
  #     property :body,    String
  #   end
  #
  #   email = Email.find("37458abc752f8413e")  # GET /riak/emails/37458abc752f8413e
  #   email.from = "someone@nowhere.net"
  #   email.save                               # PUT /riak/emails/37458abc752f8413e
  #
  #   reply = Email.new
  #   reply.from = "justin@bashoooo.com"
  #   reply.to   = "sean@geeemail.com"
  #   reply.body = "Riak is a good fit for scalable Ruby apps."
  #   reply.save                               # POST /riak/emails (Riak-assigned key)
